# Deel Take Home test - People Data Analyst

## **Scenario & Data Details**

The main purpose of this dashboard and analysis relies on the possibility that the Stakeholders may achieve by consuming the highlight indicators, and map the root-cause. They may also use filters (not included on the view) to segregate their areas of interest and check the variation on indicators.

### Desigh and Think-proccess approach:

To approach the building of this dashboard, we may rely on the usage of a app-like structure, with multiple pages being used to support the main analysis and other relavant indicators for the C-Level and Managerial population.

The first view tile summarize the current issue of first-year attrition, by highlighting indicators and key-proccess based on the approach 5W 2H;

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| What’s the issue? | Attrition during the First-Year of Employment. |
| Why? | Mapped by the Treemap of Termination Reason. |
| Who? | Mapped by the Seniority
Mapped by the Bubbleplot of Performance and Engagement Correlation. |
| Where? | Mapped by Department; |
| When? | During the First Year as the Target. |
| How? | Termination Distribution and Perfomance provide an overview and is supplemented by the Head Count Analysis, Recruitment Insights and Engagement Insights. |
| How much? | Action plan based on the findings of the Analysis may be conducted by manager, director and/or C-Level. |

Others indicators are kept as text-only on the top bar, since they provide a static view of some information that may or may not be used on the analysis. Also, two buttons on the top right of the dashboard are provided, for quick support or new requests comming from the users.

## Recomendations and other views:

Since C-Level and Manager may required more insights to draw their conclusions, we may use other pages to map this indicators, following the app-like structure. By using this type of structure, combined with filtering, more insights can be gather on the main issue, and the other categories may also be explored.

## Table of contents:

The table below represents the visuals and informations available on the other pages: 

| **Headcount Analysis** | **Recruitment Insights** | **Engagement & Performance Insights** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headcount per Department | Open Positions by Department | Bubbleplot of Performance and Engagement Correlation |
| Employees Distribution per Region | Open Positions by Quarters | Engagement Score Over Last Quarters  |
| Legal Gender Distribution | Distribution of Hiring Source | Required Attention baed on Performance Rating |
| Upper Management Gender Distribution | Candidates on Hiring Pipeline | Employees Under PIP Program |
| Employee Type Distribution | Time to Hire Distribution | High-performers by Department |
| Seniority Distribution | Onboarding Status for New Hire | Employee Performance Distribution |
| Employee Tenure | Managering and Regular Open Positions Proportion | Managers Performance Distribution |
| Avg. Span on Control |  |   |

## Executive view Overview & Indicators:

### Turnover formula:

Used the standard formula for this exercise:

$$
\text{Turnover (\%)} = 
\frac{\text{Leaver of the Period}}{\left(\frac{\text{Inicial Headcount} + \text{Final Headcount}}{2}\right)} 
\times 100

$$

---

### Turnover distribuition by Department.

Enhances the rout-cause analysis and can be used tor segregation of actions of stakeholders, which may be the next purporse of this analysis, for simplification purposes, I used  the whole company data and the average indicator on this view.  

---

### Termination Reason by Seniority

 For this case, the involuntary turnover for junior and mid-level is the highest necessity to be evaluated, but the Voluntary trends higher on the upper seniority categories.

---

### Regrettable Termination:

Use the column ***Regrettable*** to map the balance of each category. A unbalanced data is expected depending on the moment the company is facing.

---

### Treemap of Termination Reason:

Mapping the two main categories of “Voluntary” and “Not-Voluntary” termination and it’s subreason, it uses both columns (Termination Reason and Subreason) to map the volume of each category. It enhances the mapping of root-cause analysis. 

---

### Termination Distribution (Voluntary or Involuntary):

Use only the columns ***Termination Reason*** to map the balance of each category. A unbalanced data is expected depending on the moment the company is facing.

---

### Rating for Terminated Employee and Average Rating for Manager of Terminated Employee

Both indicators rely on the usage of mixed columns to map and categorize the last rating of employees when they left the company and their managers rating at the moment of employee termination.

On this indicator, we may check how the manager performance may affect the termination reason and map a possible root-cause on the analysis, since manager with many employees terminated may incur a low rating on the performance review.

---

### Bubbleplot of Performance and Engagement Correlation

Indicates the possible correlation between Performance and Engagement for terminated employees.

Major bubbles indicate a higher cluster of people with the same combination of both indicators, and on the case, the major part of involuntary employees have a similar proportion on the graph. This also indicate some outliers on the the voluntary termination, where filtering may highlight if they were also regreattable.

---

## Final input and next-steps:

C-Level and Managerial levels may infer by the indicators and previous owned informatation that Sales and R&D experience the highest turnover, mainly among Junior and Mid-Level employees, reflecting by some mean the potential mismatch between expectations, development opportunities, and cultural alignment. In more senior roles, involuntary exits often result from performance issues or restructuring, while high-performing leaders occasionally depart for better external offers, pointing to compensation and growth concerns, further actions can be taken on the compensation review, market benchmarks of reestructuring the roles and compesantion framework.

Non-regrettable exits are largely due to underperformance or cultural misalignment, which give leads a need for stronger performance management to all employees and values alignment on new hires. Regrettable turnover, driven by better offers and better career opotunities also highlights the importance of competitive rewards and clear internal pathways. 

Further Actions may be taken by Managers and executives to reinforce the cultural fit, keep a keen eye to refine performance feedback processes but keeping compensation benchmarks to reduce the current talent loss and maintain an engaged workforce.
