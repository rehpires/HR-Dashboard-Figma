Also, consider the mock-up schema as a starting point of the columns and relations built for the dashboard.

"Deel_Take_Home_test_-_People_Data_Analyst.pdf" contains the explanation of the dashboard, steps taken and design approach.

The whole contente is available in a Private Repository on GitHub for safety of issues during the upload.
